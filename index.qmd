Hi everyone! I'm Jessi. I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor degree in Environmental health. I'm a first year master student in Biostatistics program at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

I enjoy cooking, traveling and outdoor activities like hiking and skiing. Here is a photo of me at undergraduate graduation ceremony.
